        <h1>Game Rules: Simon Says Game</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start:</strong> Click the "Start" button to initiate the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow the Sequence:</strong> Watch and listen carefully as the game plays a sequence of colors and sounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat the Sequence:</strong> After the sequence is played, click on the colored buttons in the exact order that you saw and heard.</li>
        <li><strong>Simon Says:</strong> Pay attention to the "Simon Says" part. You should only repeat the sequence if the game says "Simon Says" before it. If the command doesn't include "Simon Says," do not click any buttons.</li>
        <li><strong>Increasing Difficulty:</strong> As you successfully repeat sequences, the game will gradually increase in difficulty by adding more colors to the sequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Mistakes:</strong> If you click the buttons in the wrong order, miss a button, or click when "Simon Says" wasn't stated, the game will end, and your score will be displayed.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Your score corresponds to the level you reached. Each successful sequence increases your level.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Yourself:</strong> Try to beat your high score and reach higher levels with longer sequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy and Have Fun:</strong> The Simon Says Game is a test of memory and concentration â€“ have fun while improving your skills!</li>
